# Arduino-Differential-Drive-Robot

This Arduino Differential Drive Robot has two motorized wheels and one castor wheel. The motorized wheels have encoders so
that it is possible to find out how many rotations a wheel has done. There are three short distance sensors and one long distance sensor.
The short distance sensors are placed facing forward, to the left, and to the right of the robot. The long distance sensor is placed
facing forward. There is also a color sensor placed underneath the robot. Finally, the robot also has an LCD display on top of it so that
information can be displayed.
